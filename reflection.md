### Project + Composition Description

My visual argument connects the de-emphasis of historical education to democratic backsliding and fascism, using Elon Musk’s political ascent as a defining example. It is modeled after the layout of a history textbook, featuring both historical and modern imagery in black-and-white and small print text intentionally blurred to highlight specific sentence fragments. The visual is framed by larger-print text (a quote relating forgetting the past to repeating it) at the top and bottom of the page that serves as a centering point for the argument. 

To begin constructing this visual, I started with the widely circulated image of Elon Musk on stage at a Trump inauguration event in January. The particular shot I used was sourced from Eric Lee, a photographer for the New York Times. I am using it under a fair use argument: the image is of a public figure with little expectation of privacy (especially considering the publicized nature of the event photographed), and I have transformed the image for the purposes of making a critical commentary. 

To make the figure of Musk stand out, I used the scissor selection tool to separate it into its own layer. I then applied a grayscale filter to the background layer and a layer mask to the new layer that only contained Musk’s figure. Simply selecting the object did not remove as much of the original blue background from the edges as I had hoped, so I used the eraser tool on the layer mask to remove those pixels from the outline. The screenshot below shows the layer mask edited around the silhouette in the layers menu.

I added the large text lining the top and bottom of the screen next, experimenting with fonts and colors for readability. I found that the top of the grayscale background was much darker than the bottom, and the first half of the quote was easiest read in white while the second half was better in black. I wanted both sections to be consistent, so I used the dodge/burn tool to lighten the area of background directly behind where I wanted to place my text. This approach was very effective, as the screenshots below show.

As noted in my proposal, my original plan was not to use a textbook-like layout for the main body but to stack relevant headlines overtop of each other to make my argument. When I started on this route, I decided against typing the headlines out in text boxes and crediting them more explicitly elsewhere because I didn’t think it would come across as credible. I collected screenshots from various news outlets and had to lighten many of them using dodge/burn because their webpage background colors were not consistent. Each of them had a unique font, as well, creating further visual inconsistency. I eventually decided that the amount of meticulous editing I was doing was not only too intensive, but not quite achieving the effect I hoped it would. I decided to change course and reverted to the textbook idea, one I had thought of earlier in our class generative writing process. Now that I have a finished product, I am glad I went the route I did because I think it’s both more visually appealing and more intuitively connected to the argument I’m making. 

To achieve this textbook-like design, I used a small-print, generic-looking font for the body of the text. I used a filler “lorem ipsum” text to fill the space and typed out sentence fragments that emulate the ideas of the headlines I was originally going to use (book bans, declining literacy rates, and lack of enrollment in humanities programs). Sources for claims made there can be found under credits.md. To make these parts stand out among the rest of the text, they are bold and in a larger font size. I also used the blur paintbrush tool over the filler text to help it blend further into the background, as seen below.

Finally, the small images in either corner are both in black-and-white to highlight the historical nature of the argument. The image from 1942 was already in black-and-white, so I applied a similar filter to the one from 2025. As you probably noticed, the labels for each image correspond to the year they were taken, but in the style of how you would see an image or chart labelled in a history textbook. The caption box, also highlighted in red to ensure it was noticed, attached to the top-right hand corner was included to make further reference to the textbook style, but also to double as space to direct viewers to outside resources and more information. 

### Feedback

During the workshop, Maddie suggested that I include information on where viewers can find out more about this topic. 

> “Just as you include a link to a reputable source in your readme section, I think it could be beneficial to add a QR code or list a website where your audience can learn more information. As someone who doesn't know too much about this issue, I would love to have somewhere to go where I could find out more (reputable) information. While this might make your image a little bit crowded, I think it's worthwhile and something to consider.” - Maddie

I agreed that this was a good idea, and I did have a small area of unfilled space in the center-right of the screen that I had been struggling to decide what to do with. Upon hearing from someone who thought more information would be worthwhile, I filled that space with the pseudo-caption box that exists there now. 

I also heard from both Yang and Shreya that some of the textual aspects were difficult to read:

> “Some of the background elements (like the text discussing literacy rates and book bans) blend in too much with the design.” - Yang

> “...maybe making the red a brighter/lighter color would help? There's some parts that it kind of blends into the dark background…” - Shreya

To address the first issue, I increased the font size of the highlighted text and decreased the size of the blurred text. For the red text, I replicated each instance in black and placed them behind the red word at a lower opacity to make them appear to pop out of the page, making them less two-dimensional. 

### Baseline + Aspirational Criteria

My visual includes a clearly articulated message conveyed in a font matching the style of the piece (bold and dramatic for the title; in the style of textbook type and headers for the rest) and at least three layers. It was created using tools beyond the basics and lives in a repository containing credited assets and clear commit messages made throughout the composition process. Finally, it uses arrangement, size, color and contrast to provide focus. For example, I used a similar scale for font sizes as recommended by Midori Nediger in the assigned reading on how to choose fonts based on your design (the body text is in 12pt, the quote attribution is 18pt, the figure headings in 27pt, etc). Further, I used the principle of proximity to separate modern day events from historical ones. The text on issues seen today is positioned next to the modern photo while the historical notes are next to the historical photo, cementing the separation between these two ideas. Each half of the main quotation are also positioned most closely to the concept, either modern or historical, that they reference. Finally, the red color of selected pieces of text draws attention quickly, helping to establish those aspects as the top of the visual hierarchy. This pop of color, as well as leaving Musk’s figure colorized, creates contrast with the rest of the mostly grayscaled image. These ideas are clear to audiences, as evidenced by the feedback I received:

> “The very first thing I noticed was the bright red words "remember" and "repeat" because they contrast with the black and white background and text surrounding it. I think choosing these words and the color red are effective to your argument because they are bold and hold a lot of meaning to your argument.” - Maddie

> “Mainly, my eyes are drawn to the image of Elon Musk and the two words in red.” - Shreya

Regarding aspirational criteria, I believe I have met several of them. My layers are clearly labelled and organized within my .xcf file, and the files in my repository are organized as well. My project contains more than three overlapping layers and was created using several new-to-me tools and filters in GIMP, such as strokes, desaturation, blur, dodge/burn, and layer masks. Further, it includes a way to access more information about the topic. Finally, the feedback I received indicates that my message is clear to audience members: 

> “I clearly see the visual argument you are trying to make (not making the same mistakes as the past).” - Shreya

### Conclusion

Overall, I greatly enjoyed working on this project and learning to use GIMP. I can see myself using it to create other visuals if the need should arise in the future. I am also passionate about the issue I chose to draw attention to, causing me to look forward to making progress on this piece throughout the process.
