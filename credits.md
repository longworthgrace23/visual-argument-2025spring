# Preview (2/18)

So far, work on my project has largely been in experimenting with the different tools GIMP offers to achieve the visual impact I want. For this preview, I was able to separate an image – what will end up being the core of the visual – into two distinct layers. I used a selection tool to create a new layer with just one object from the original image and a layer mask to refine that new layer. 

Moving forward, my goal is to build up the content surrounding the primary figure that’s currently featured, which will ultimately make my argument. I will need to make stylistic choices about how that content will be laid out – specifically, whether I want to use screenshots of published headlines like I mentioned in my proposal for authenticity or recreate them in type for visual consistency. In either case, I would also like to devote some time to ensuring these supplemental pieces are ethically sourced and properly attributed.

# Proposal (2/16)

The primary argument of my visual composition will involve establishing parallels between contemporary American politics and the politics of Germany in the 1930s as it descended into Nazism. Further, I will attempt to connect these parallels to the current trend in American education of devaluing humanities fields in favor of the sciences. To achieve this, I am planning to highlight Elon Musk’s recent political ascent, including the recognizable salute he gave at an inauguration event last month and a recent speech he gave to Germany’s far-right party, AFD, encouraging the nation to move on from “past guilt.” These aspects will make up the foreground of the argument, while the background will make the comparison between America today and Germany then. At the top of the page, the background will feature headlines related to book bans, falling literacy rates, the comparative lack of funding in humanities-related departments vs. their STEM counterparts at universities, and anti-immigrant rhetoric. As one moves down the page, the contents of the background will shift into historical imagery and accounts that stemmed from similar policies to the ones seen today (book burnings, Nazi propaganda that established anti-Jewish sentiments, etc). In the middle of the page, between these top and bottom sections, headlines from op-eds and think pieces on the growing concern over the similarities I point out will serve as a transition between the two ideas. 

The triggering idea for this argument was a famous axiom from a Spanish philosopher named George Santayana: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Recent events have reminded me of this quote, and I will include it as the primary text for my visual. I feel that Elon Musk and his recent series of actions serve as a clear example of what this quote warns against. By highlighting the recent phenomenon of deemphasizing knowledge of history in conjunction with similarities between the US and Nazi Germany using Musk as a centering example, I hope to effectively argue the relationship between the disregard for historical education and democratic backsliding.
